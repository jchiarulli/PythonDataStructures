# A queue is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the
# First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
# Lists are not efficient to implement a queue, because append() and pop() from the 
# beginning and end of a list is not fast and incur memory movement cost.
# Also, insertion at the end and deletion from the beginning of a list is not so fast
# since it requires a shift in the element positions.
